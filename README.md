# InsightHub
From Adoption to Usage: Unveiling Programming Language Patterns and Trends in GitHub Repositories with InsightHub

Live Demo: https://rapid-domain-384109.de.r.appspot.com/

In InsightHub, we conduct an in-depth analysis of programming language trends and usage in GitHub repositories by utilizing InsightHub, a comprehensive and interactive web application. By examining metadata from over 2.8 million open-source repositories, the study employs various data visualization techniques to explore the frequency and popularity of programming languages. InsightHub enables users to investigate language rankings, paradigms, types, and purposes based on the number of commits, pull requests, and repositories over time. The application facilitates the discovery of interesting insights from GitHub data, empowering users to make informed decisions about language adoption and usage. By offering a range of customizable data visualization components, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the ever-evolving landscape of programming languages in the context of GitHub repositories


InsightHub is an application designed to provide users with valuable insights into data and trends in a variety of domains. Its main aim is to help users make informed decisions based on accurate and relevant information.

### Instructions for Running Scripts in the Project
In the project directory, you have access to the following scripts:
#### 1. Start the Development Server

## Installation

Install InsightHub with npm

```bash
  npm start
```

This command runs the app in development mode. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app. The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

#### 2. Build the App for Production
```bash
  npm run build
```

Use this script to build the app for production in the build folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The resulting build is minified, and the filenames include hashes, making your app ready for deployment. For more information about deployment, consult the appropriate documentation section.
